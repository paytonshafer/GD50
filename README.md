# GD50 project solutions
GD50: Intoduction to Game Development is a free online course offered by Hardvard University that can be found [here](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-game-development)
The course consists of 12 lectures, each one goes into a dive about a game and goes through how to develop it. The games that are looked at are Super Mario
Bros., Pong, Flappy Bird, Breakout, Match 3, Legend of Zelda, Angry Birds, Pokémon, 3D Helicopter Game, Dreadhalls, Portal. The first 75% of the course
is done in lua using LÖVE as the rendering engine, this is for 2D games and works great for retro games. The rest of the course is done using C# and Unity
as the redering engine. Each project has you take the game that was created at the end of the lecture and make it your own by adding more to it, whether it
may be adding your own levels or implementing new features. The final project is to create a game of my very own, this is in the final project folder.

# Instalation
Ensure that you have LÖVE2D downloaded and that you can use it. _add part about C#/Unity_. Then download all the source code.

# Usage
For Pong, Flappy Bird, Breakout, ... (add them as I do them):
cd into the proper directory of the game you want to run, then run this command to start the game:
```sh
love ./
```
or
```sh
love .
```

For (add unity game)
cd into the proper directory of the game you want to run, then run this command to start the game:
```sh

```
